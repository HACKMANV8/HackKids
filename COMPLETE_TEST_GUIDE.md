## 🎯 Demo Script for Judges

### **1. Introduction (30 seconds)**
"VeriSeal is a tamper-proof package tracking system using ESP32 sensors and blockchain verification."

### **2. Show Normal Flow (2 minutes)**

**Logistics:**
- "The logistics person scans the QR code from the package"
- "The QR contains real-time ESP32 sensor data"
- "They can see temperature, humidity, battery, and tamper status"
- "After reviewing, they upload the data and mark it to proceed"

**Receiver:**
- "The receiver scans the QR and enters their PIN"
- "They see the complete journey with all checkpoints"
- "Each checkpoint shows the exact sensor readings at that time"
- "Full transparency - they know exactly what happened to their package"

### **3. Show Tamper Detection (1 minute)**

**Logistics:**
- "Now let's scan a tampered package"
- "Notice the temperature is 45°C - way too high!"
- "Tamper status shows 'Tampered' in red"
- "The logistics person marks it to return to sender"

**Receiver:**
- "The receiver can see exactly where tampering occurred"
- "Checkpoint 1 was fine, but Checkpoint 2 detected the issue"
- "Complete audit trail with timestamps and sensor data"

### **4. Key Features (30 seconds)**
- ✅ Offline operation - ESP32 doesn't need internet
- ✅ Manual verification - Human oversight at every step
- ✅ Complete transparency - Receiver sees everything
- ✅ Immutable logs - All data stored in database

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "404 Not Found" on scan-qr
- Restart backend server
- Check you're using POST method
- Verify Authorization header

### ESP32 data not showing
- Check QR JSON format is correct
- Ensure `esp32_data` object exists
- Verify all required fields present

### Journey not displaying
- Check PIN is correct
- Verify package has scan_logs in database
- Check browser console for errors

### Upload button disabled
- Must scan QR code first
- Check package_token is valid
- Verify logged in as delivery user

---

## 📊 Success Metrics

After testing, you should have:
- ✅ 2+ packages with complete journeys
- ✅ Normal and tampered package examples
- ✅ All ESP32 data visible at each checkpoint
- ✅ Receiver can see complete audit trail
- ✅ "Okay" button works to reset scanner
