## 🔄 Complete System Flow

### **1. Package Creation (Sender)**
```
Sender creates package
    ↓
Backend generates package_token
    ↓
ESP32 device attached to package
    ↓
ESP32 generates QR code with sensor data
```

### **2. At Each Checkpoint (Logistics)**
```
📦 Package arrives at checkpoint
    ↓
📷 Logistics scans QR with website camera
    ↓
📊 Website displays:
    - Temperature: 22.5°C
    - Tamper Status: Secure
    - Loop Status: Connected
    - Battery: 85%
    - Humidity: 45%
    ↓
✅ Logistics reviews data
    ↓
🔘 Clicks "Upload & Proceed" or "Return to Sender"
    ↓
🗄️ Data saved to database (scan_logs array)
```

### **3. Final Delivery (Receiver)**
```
📦 Package delivered
    ↓
📷 Receiver scans QR with website camera
    ↓
🔐 Receiver enters 6-digit PIN
    ↓
📜 Receiver sees complete journey:
    
    ✅ Checkpoint 1: Warehouse Dispatch
       🌡️ Temp: 22.5°C | 🔒 Tamper: Secure | 🔌 Loop: Connected
       ⏰ Oct 31, 8:00 AM | ✅ Action: Proceed
    
    ✅ Checkpoint 2: Local Hub
       🌡️ Temp: 23.1°C | 🔒 Tamper: Secure | 🔌 Loop: Connected
       ⏰ Oct 31, 12:00 PM | ✅ Action: Proceed
    
    ✅ Checkpoint 3: Regional Center
       🌡️ Temp: 22.8°C | 🔒 Tamper: Secure | 🔌 Loop: Connected
       ⏰ Oct 31, 4:00 PM | ✅ Action: Proceed
    
    ✅ Checkpoint 4: Delivery Hub
       🌡️ Temp: 23.5°C | 🔒 Tamper: Secure | 🔌 Loop: Connected
       ⏰ Oct 31, 8:00 PM | ✅ Action: Proceed
    ↓
✅ Receiver clicks "Okay" to confirm
```

### **4. Sender Dashboard**
```
📊 Sender logs in
    ↓
📦 Sees all packages with real-time status
    ↓
🔍 Clicks on PKG001
    ↓
📜 Sees same journey as receiver:
    - All checkpoint scans
    - ESP32 sensor data at each checkpoint
    - Actions taken (proceed/return)
    - Timestamps
```
